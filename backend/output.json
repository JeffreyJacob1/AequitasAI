Basic requirements: Even though Joe has no assets, a will should still meet basic legal requirements. This typically includes:\n   - Being in writing\n   - Signed by Joe (the testator)\n   - Witnessed by at least two people (in most states)\n\n2. Age and competency: Joe must be at least 18 years old and mentally competent to create a valid will.\n\n3. Cremation wishes: Since Joe wants to be cremated, this should be clearly stated in the will. \n\n4. No assets: Although Joe has no assets, it's still important to state this in the will to avoid any confusion.\n\n5. Executor: Joe should name an executor to handle any final affairs, even if there are no assets to distribute.\n\n6. State-specific requirements: The exact requirements may vary by state, so it's important to check local laws.\n\n7. Self-proving affidavit: While not required in all states, having the will notarized can make it easier to prove its validity later.\n\nGiven Joe's simple situation, he might consider using a free online will-making tool like FreeWill or a basic template from a site like LegalZoom or LawDepot. However, if there are any complexities not mentioned (such as minor children or potential future assets), it would be wise to consult with a legal professional.\n\nRemember, even a simple will should be properly executed to ensure it's legally valid. This typically means signing it in the presence of witnesses who also sign the document."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":856,"output_tokens":356}}
